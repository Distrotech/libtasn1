.SH NAME
asn1_bit_der \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "void asn1_bit_der(const unsigned char * " str ", int " bit_len ", unsigned char * " der ", int * " der_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const unsigned char * str" 12
BIT string.
.IP "int bit_len" 12
number of meaningful bits in STR.
.IP "unsigned char * der" 12
string returned.
.IP "int * der_len" 12
number of meaningful bytes of DER
(der[0]..der[ans_len\-1]).
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates a length\-value DER encoding for the input data
as it would have been for a BIT STRING.
The DER encoded data will be copied in \fIder\fP.

Note that the BIT STRING tag is not included in the output.

This function does not return any value because it is expected
that \fIder_len\fP will contain enough bytes to store the string
plus the DER encoding. The DER encoding size can be obtained using
\fBasn1_length_der()\fP.
