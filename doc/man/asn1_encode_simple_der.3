.SH NAME
asn1_encode_simple_der \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_encode_simple_der(unsigned int " etype ", const unsigned char * " str ", unsigned int " str_len ", unsigned char * " tl ", unsigned int * " tl_len ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "unsigned int etype" 12
The type of the string to be encoded (ASN1_ETYPE_)
.IP "const unsigned char * str" 12
the string data.
.IP "unsigned int str_len" 12
the string length
.IP "unsigned char * tl" 12
the encoded tag and length
.IP "unsigned int * tl_len" 12
the bytes of the \fItl\fP field
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Creates the DER encoding for various simple ASN.1 types like strings etc.
It stores the tag and length in \fItl\fP, which should have space for at least
\fBASN1_MAX_TL_SIZE\fP bytes. Initially \fItl_len\fP should contain the size of \fItl\fP.

The complete DER encoding should consist of the value in \fItl\fP appended
with the provided \fIstr\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if successful or an error value.
