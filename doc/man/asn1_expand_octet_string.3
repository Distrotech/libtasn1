.SH NAME
asn1_expand_octet_string \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <libtasn1.h>
.sp
.BI "int asn1_expand_octet_string(asn1_node " definitions ", asn1_node * " element ", const char * " octetName ", const char * " objectName ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "asn1_node definitions" 12
ASN1 definitions
.IP "asn1_node * element" 12
pointer to an ASN1 structure
.IP "const char * octetName" 12
name of the OCTECT STRING field to expand.
.IP "const char * objectName" 12
name of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER field to use to define
the type for expansion.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Expands an "OCTET STRING" element of a structure created from a DER
decoding process (the \fBasn1_der_decoding()\fP function).  The type used
for expansion is the first one following the definition of the
actual value of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER indicated by OBJECTNAME.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBASN1_SUCCESS\fP if substitution OK, \fBASN1_ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND\fP
if \fIobjectName\fP or \fIoctetName\fP are not correct,
\fBASN1_VALUE_NOT_VALID\fP if it wasn't possible to find the type to
use for expansion, or other errors depending on DER decoding.
