Subject: GNU Libtasn1 2.11 released
<#part sign=pgpmime>
GNU Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER/BER encoding/decoding.  GNU Libtasn1 is used by
GnuTLS to handle X.509 structures and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
V5 structures.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.11 (2011-11-25) [stable]
- qa: Now builds without compiler warnings with Solaris CC.
- qa: Added clang analysis.  Fixed cyclomatic complexity output.
- tests: Added self-test of bit string functions.
- build: Added windows/libtasn14win.mk rules to produce Windows binaries.
- build: Don't hard code path to perl in doc/gdoc.
- Various minor fixes.

There is a known problem building this release on MinGW with MSVC as the
compiler, fortunately there is a workaround available -- please see
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2011-11/msg00001.html
for more information.

Commercial support contracts for Libtasn1 are available, and they help
finance continued maintenance.  Simon Josefsson Datakonsult AB, a
Stockholm based privately held company, is currently funding Libtasn1
maintenance.  We are always looking for interesting development
projects.  See http://josefsson.org/ for more details.

For developers interested in improving code quality, we publish
Cyclomatic code complexity charts that help you find code that may
need review and improvements:
  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/cyclo/

Code coverage charts indicate parts of the source code that needs
to be tested better by the included self-tests:
  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/coverage/

Clang can analyse the source code for common problems, here is its
report for libtasn1:

The software is cryptographically signed by the author using an
OpenPGP key identified by the following information:
